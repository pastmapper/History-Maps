    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p>
      This website presents interactive maps based on historical land records from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
      General Land Office. The maps are designed to help explore how land was distributed to individuals during the early
      settlement of Skagit County and surrounding areas.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is educational. It provides a visual way to examine patterns of early land claims,
      settlement, and federal land distribution using modern mapping tools and historical source records.
    </p>

    <h2>Data sources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bureau of Land Management (BLM) General Land Office patent records</li>
      <li>Public Land Survey System (PLSS) cadastral data</li>
      <li>OpenStreetMap base map layers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accuracy and limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Parcel boundaries shown on these maps are approximate and are intended for historical visualization only.
      These maps should not be used for legal, surveying, or property boundary determination.
    </p>

    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>
      This project was created by Corrinne Sande in 2026 as part of an effort to document and visualize early federal land
      claims and settlement history in Skagit County, Washington.
