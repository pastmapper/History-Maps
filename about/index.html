<h1>About This Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This website presents interactive historical maps based on land patent records from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) General Land Office.
</p>

<p>
The maps are designed to help explore how land was distributed to individuals during the early settlement of Skagit County and surrounding areas, using modern mapping tools to visualize historical records.
</p>

<p>
This project is intended for historical and educational use.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to provide an accessible, visual way to examine patterns of early land claims, settlement, and federal land distribution.
</p>

<p>
It supports local historical research and public understanding of how early communities developed across the landscape.
</p>

<h2>Independence and Authorship</h2>
<p>
This is an independent historical mapping project created and maintained by <strong>Corrinne Sande</strong> in 2026.
</p>

<p>
It is not an official publication of any historical association or organization.
</p>

<p>
All content and interpretations presented on this site are the responsibility of the project author.
</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bureau of Land Management (BLM) General Land Office patent records</li>
  <li>Public Land Survey System (PLSS) cadastral data</li>
  <li>OpenStreetMap base map layers</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additional historical context may be drawn from publicly available records and local historical research.
</p>

<h2>Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
<p>
Parcel boundaries shown on these maps are approximate and intended for historical visualization only.
</p>

<p>
These maps should not be used for legal, surveying, or property boundary determination.
</p>

<p>
Historical records vary in accuracy and completeness, and some locations may be approximate.
</p>

<h2>Future Development</h2>
<p>
This project may expand over time to include additional maps and historical content as research continues.
</p>

<p>
Any future use of historical photographs or archival materials will be done with permission and with proper acknowledgment of the source.
</p>
