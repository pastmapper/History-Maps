    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This website presents interactive historical maps based on land patent records from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) General Land Office.</p>
    <p>The maps are designed to help explore how land was distributed to individuals during the early settlement of Skagit County and surrounding areas, using modern mapping tools to visualize historical records.</p>
    <p>This project is intended for historical and educational use.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to provide an accessible, visual way to examine patterns of early land claims, settlement, and federal land distribution.</p>
    <p>It supports local historical research and public understanding of how early communities developed across the landscape.</p>

    <h2>Independence and Authorship</h2>
    <p>This is an independent historical mapping project created and maintained by <strong>Corrinne Sande</strong> in 2026.</p>
    <p>It is not an official publication of any historical association or organization.</p>
    <p>All content and interpretations presented on this site are the responsibility of the project author.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bureau of Land Management (BLM) General Land Office patent records</li>
      <li>Public Land Survey System (PLSS) cadastral data</li>
      <li>OpenStreetMap base map layers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional historical context may be drawn from publicly available records and local historical research.</p>
<h2>General Limitations</h2>
<p>This project is intended for historical visualization and educational use only.</p>
<p>Map features and boundaries are based on historical records and modern interpretation and may be approximate.</p>
